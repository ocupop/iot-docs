          "a": "<p>Many people use smart-home devices in their daily lives.From smart bulbs and plugs to TVs and kitchen appliances, we’re living in the age of the Internet-of-Things (IoT). While these devices can enrich our lives, they may also have negative impacts on our data security, or put our privacy at risk.</p><p>Many IoT devices are designed with poor security practices, such as using hard-coded passwords, lack of strong authentication, or not running updates. Devices could also be hacked, and an attacker could potentially control the devices or steal sensitive information.</p><p>Further, having many IoT devices in the home can mean competition for limited bandwidth, which may degrade the overall performance of the home network.</p><p>The Home Data Inspector measures and visualizes these risks, both for you in your own home life, and for researchers to better understand the risks of IoT devices.  It is an open-source software that you can download to inspect your home network and identify any privacy, security, and performance problems associated with your IoT devices. </p>"
