          "q": "What is the Home Data Inspector project?",
          "a": "<p>Many people use smart-home devices in their daily lives.From smart bulbs and plugs to TVs and kitchen appliances, we’re living in the age of the Internet-of-Things (IoT). While these devices can enrich our lives, they may also have negative impacts on our data security, or put our privacy at risk.</p><p>Many IoT devices are designed with poor security practices, such as using hard-coded passwords, lack of strong authentication, or not running updates. Devices could also be hacked, and an attacker could potentially control the devices or steal sensitive information.</p><p>Further, having many IoT devices in the home can mean competition for limited bandwidth, which may degrade the overall performance of the home network.</p><p>The Home Data Inspector measures and visualizes these risks, both for you in your own home life, and for researchers to better understand the risks of IoT devices.  It is an open-source software that you can download to inspect your home network and identify any privacy, security, and performance problems associated with your IoT devices. </p>"

          "q": "What is the Home Data Inspector tool?",
          "a": "<p>Home Data Inspector is a Windows/Linux/Mac application that you can run on laptops or desktops (It does not work on tablets or smartphones). By using a technique known as “ARP spoofing,” this software monitors the network activities of all IoT devices connected to the home network (e.g., your “smart” appliances).  For the more technically minded folks who would like to see the open source software, click here. </p><p>Home Data Inspector is also a research tool - it can collect anonymized data that helps us better understand the universe of IoT devices — specifically, measuring and mitigating their security, privacy, and performance problems.  As an individual user, you do not need to share data with our researchers to use Home Data Inspector - you can choose to toggle on or off data sharing as you see fit.</p> <p>or more information about our research, visit <a href=\"https://iotinspector.org/\">https://iotinspector.org/</a>.</p>"

          "q": "Do I have to share data back with Consumer Reports and NYU researchers to be able to use Home Data Inspector? ",

        },
        {
          "q": "What type of analysis will be done with the information I submitted?",
          "a": "<ul><li>It is difficult to produce generalizable results in the study of IoT security and privacy. Although a researcher can purchase a few devices and conduct penetration tests on them in lab settings, the conclusion may not apply to diverse devices that are actually being used in consumer homes or enterprise networks.  One way to mitigate this problem is to look at network traffic from network service providers or from antivirus companies. Unfortunately, such datasets are likely to be proprietary and access may be limited to select researchers. Furthermore, the identities of IoT devices are unlikely to be labelled in such datasets; without this ground truth, it could be difficult to analyze IoT-specific traffic or make conclusions on individual types of IoT devices.</li><li>With IoT Inspector, we are the first in the research community to produce an open-source, anonymized dataset of actual IoT network traffic, where the identity of each device is labelled. We hope to invite any academic researchers to collaborate with us — e.g., to analyze the data or to improve the data collection — and advance our knowledge on IoT security, privacy, and other related fields (e.g., network performance).</li><li><b>Access & Choice</b> By comparing your bill with thousands of others, we will be able to see where prices are higher or lower for the same service. Over time, we hope to determine the factors that explain other factors that account for price differences. For our initial study, we will only use zip code data, and NOT street addresses, to detect these geographical differences. </li><li><b>Confusing Pricing</b> Internet service can be bundled with phone or cable TV service, so the cost of internet may not even be listed on the monthly bill. Other bills may not disclose the promised speed being paid for, and the price can vary significantly depending on if a promotional rate is applied or expired.</li><li><b>Hidden Fees</b>  Bills can be padded with hidden fees made up by the internet service provider that you might not have even known were there. For example, some providers impose a non-optional “network access and maintenance fee” that is not a government fee, but a fee entirely made up by the ISP.</li></ul><p>We will release our findings in a journal/conference publication, and in Consumer Reports articles and content.  We hope to provide consumers who are unsure whether to buy a new IoT device with guidance on that device’s comparable privacy and security.  Furthermore, the Digital Lab at Consumer Reports will publish the results of our study in a more publicly accessible form. </p><p>Further, our study will provide more transparency about privacy, security and performance issues regarding IoT devices. We expect the increased transparency to encourage vendors to manufacture more private, secure and performant devices, which is a net gain for the society as whole.</p>"

Similarly, this text does not typically include any personally identifiable information. For example, a Wemo smart plug typically announces itself as &ldquo;wemo&rdquo; via DHCP. </p> </li> </ul> <p>(We collect from the sources above because some IoT devices may use none or some of the sources above for self-identification.)</p> <ul> <li> <p >TLS handshake — i.e., a short piece of data (typically fewer than 3,000 characters) that your IoT device sends to the Internet in order to establish a secure connection.</p> </li> <ul> <li > <p >This text does not typically include any personally identifiable information.</p> </li> <li > <p >We use this data to identify potentially vulnerable IoT devices — for instance, because they are using an outdated or insecure encryption function, in which case we notify the user of the risks of using the device.</p> </li> </ul> </ul> <p>For exact details of how we collect these data, see the source code: https://github.com/noise-lab/iot-inspector-client/blob/master/src/data_upload.py.

All data collected from your IoT devices is stored on a secure server at NYU. Home Data Inspector transmits data to our server over a secure channel, i.e., HTTPS.</p><p>As a result of our privacy and security practices, no one has access to the collected data except researchers at Consumer Reports and at NYU. Based on the data we do collect, researchers are unable to infer what IoT devices you specifically own, and what you do with your devices.</p><p>We do this by assigning each user a unique ID, generated at random when the user first runs Home Data .

          "q": "What are some risks of running IoT Inspector on my computer?",
          "a": "<p>Performance degradation: Running IoT Inspector may reduce your network performance. If you are doing latency-sensitive activities, such as playing video games or holding video chats, we recommend that you turn off IoT Inspector. In fact, some of our users complained that IoT Inspector brought down their entire network; if this happens, stop IoT Inspector and reboot your router. Furthermore, IoT Inspector is experimental software is provided “as is;” we have not comprehensively tested IoT Inspector on all IoT devices or with all possible configurations. As a result, it may fail to work and disconnect your home devices. In this case, simply turning off IoT Inspector and rebooting your home router would likely solve the issues. If you have any critical medical devices, for instance, we suggest you exclude such devices from IoT Inspector or withdrawl from the study.</p><p><b>Data breach:</b> In the unlikely event that our secure server is compromised, an attacker will have access to this form and the collected data. However, the attacker will be unable to infer what IoT devices you own (because the attacker would not know the real-world identities behind each device), and what you do with your devices.</p><p><b>Best-effort support:</b> We will regularly maintain and update the software (e.g., fixing bugs) whenever necessary. In case of questions, we try our best to respond to email inquiries within 24 hours during weekdays. However, we do not guarantee long-terms support of the software. Also, we do not guarantee we will answer everyone’s questions if our capacity reaches a certain limit. In the event that IoT Inspector disrupts the normal functionality of your network, simply turn off IoT Inspector.</p>"

Please don’t enter your name as a part of any labeling you do on Home Data Inspector! </p><p>IoT Inspector automatically scans the network to guess likely identities of devices on the network. A part of this scan uses SSDP/mDNS, which is a way for devices to announce their identities to their network. Sometimes, a device’s own announcement may contain private information. For instance, a Chromecast may announce its name along with the video you’re streaming on YouTube.</p><p>IoT Inspector also parses DHCP Request packets that devices broadcast to the entire network — a part of the effort to identify devices. These packets may contain sensitive information, as well. For instance, an iPhone’s DHCP Request packets may say “Danny’s iPhone”.</p><p><i><b>Do we need new screenshots here?  Or links to the right page?</b></i></p><p>Users can remove data gathered in 2 and 3 by clicking the “Remove” link, as shown below. </p><p>For example, my Macbook may be discovered, and my name was transmitted to Princeton:Screenshot of renaming devices</p><p>After clicking the “Remove link”, my name dispappeared:Screenshot of renaming devices</p>"

It is true that the attacker would be able to see what device contacted what domains at what time, but beyond this information, it is unlikely that the attacker would be able to infer the real-world identities behind individual devices. This is because we do not collect any personally identifiable information such as your Internet-facing IP address (see this question); for instance, we have disabled IP logging on our webserver (https://dashboard.iotinspector.org), so we don’t really know which IP address is running IoT Inspector.</p><p>Furthermore, even if IoT Inspector accidentally collects sensitive information, you can remove it from the user interface (see this question).</p>"

In particular, we should retain the data long enough for any external researchers to challenge our findings, but not too long such that the data is forgotten or breached.</p><p>As such, we have decided to retain the data on our server (at NYU) for at most a year after we publish a paper on our findings in an academic journal/conference.

With NYU IRB’s approval, the NYU researchers will grant full data access to the non-NYU entities.

This action is against our policies as stated in the consent form, but someone could still use IoT Inspector to monitor the network without the consent of everyone on the same network.</p><p>We attempt to make it very difficult to a malicious user to monitor the network traffic of non-IoT devices. Here’s how:</p><p>We have a set of best-effort heuristics to determine if a device is non-IoT. For instance, we use Fingerbank to guess the identity of each device, based on the OUI of the MAC address as well as the destination hosts contacted. Also, we look at the DHCP Request packets and the SSDP messages to determine if a device is non-IoT.</p><p>Note: These heuristics may introduce false positives and false negatives (i.e., a non-IoT device not being marked as non-IoT, and an IoT device being marked as non-IoT).</p><p>Screenshot of device being marked as non-IoT</p><p>For each non-IoT device, if a user attempts to view what communication endpoints the device has contacted (e.g., to spy on a roommate’s browsing history), the user will see the following lock screen.</p><p>Screenshot of device being locked</p><p>The user would have to enter the first 6 characters of the MAC address to unlock the screen. This screen serves as a deterrence to users who don’t have physical access to devices to which they wish to monitor.</p><p>The effort above, again, serves as a mitigation, rather than a solution. A malicious user can, for instance, scan the network to obtain MAC address of the device they wish to spy on, thereby circumventing the checks in Step 2. Our mitigation here aims to deter non-technical users from abusing our tool, rather than highly technical users (who probably do not need IoT Inspector to spy on their housemates anyways).</p>"
